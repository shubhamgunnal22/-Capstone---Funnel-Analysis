# Capstone---Funnel-Analysis
Upon completion of the capstone project, I conducted a comprehensive Funnel Analysis for a leading food eCommerce platform. The objective was to gain insights into the company's performance in 2019 using data from the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, which comprised three key worksheets: Session Details, Channel wise traffic, and Supporting Data.

1. Session Details Sheet Analysis:
 - I was tasked with identifying fluctuations in the number of orders.
 - Filling in missing data in the Session Details sheet based on provided definitions was part of my responsibilities.
 - I pinpointed dates of order highs and lows relative to the same day the previous week, paying particular attention to weekends when company experienced increased orders.
 - Highlighting highs (above 20%) and lows (below -20%), while disregarding differences within the 20% range, was part of my analysis.

2. Channel wise Traffic Sheet Analysis:
 - I identified changes in traffic compared to the previous week's corresponding days.
 - Determining the sources of traffic fluctuations using the Channel wise traffic sheet was also part of my role.

3. Overall Conversion Analysis:
 - I assessed changes in overall conversion rates relative to the same day the previous week.
 - Breaking down conversion rates into smaller metrics: L2M, M2C, C2P, and P2O, was conducted by me.
 - I identified specific conversions that fluctuated and hypothesized potential reasons for these fluctuations.
 - Validating hypotheses using data from the Supporting Data sheet was part of my analysis process.

In summary, I successfully completed the project, conducting a meticulous examination of company's performance metrics and providing actionable insights into order trends, traffic sources, and conversion fluctuations, which informed strategic decision-making for the company.
